Recent developments in computing, data entry and generation, and analytic tools have changed the landscape of modern demography and health research. These changes have come to be known as computational demography, big data, and precision health in the field. This emerging interdisciplinary research comprises social scientists, physical scientists, engineers, data scientists, and disease experts. This work has changed how we use administrative data, conduct surveys, and allow for complex behavioral studies via big data (electronic trace data from mobile phones, apps, etc.). This chapter reviews this emerging field's new data sources, methods, and applications.
